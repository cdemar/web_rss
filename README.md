# RSS Feed Reader

## Overview

RSS Feed Reader is a simple web application that allows users to fetch and display RSS feed entries from a provided RSS feed URL. This application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Fetch RSS Feeds:** Users can enter an RSS feed URL and fetch entries from the feed.
- **Display Entries:** Entries from the RSS feed are displayed with titles, publication dates, and descriptions.
- **Error Handling:** Provides user feedback for invalid URLs or failed fetch attempts.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the application works well on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (including CSS Variables and Media Queries)
- JavaScript (including Fetch API for data retrieval)

## Cybersecurity Measures

### Input Sanitization

- **URL Encoding:** Before fetching the RSS feed using the Fetch API, the input URL is encoded using `encodeURIComponent()` to prevent injection attacks and ensure proper handling of special characters.

### Network Security

- **API Usage:** The application uses a trusted RSS2JSON API (`https://api.rss2json.com`) to fetch RSS feed data securely over HTTPS. This ensures that data transmission is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping.

### Error Handling

- **Network Errors:** Proper error handling is implemented to manage cases where the API request fails (e.g., due to network issues or server errors). Error messages are displayed to users to inform them of the issue without exposing sensitive information.

### Accessibility and Privacy

- **Visually Hidden Elements:** Elements such as form instructions (`visually-hidden` class) are implemented to maintain accessibility for users relying on screen readers, ensuring privacy without compromising usability.

To get started, you can use the following example RSS feed URL:

- [The Hacker News RSS Feed](https://feeds.feedburner.com/TheHackersNews)

Copy and paste the above URL into the input field and click "Fetch" to see the RSS feed entries.
